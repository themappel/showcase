# Showcase  

Hello, this repository shows a few projects I've lead and implemented over the years. Many of my personal github repositories are private, and I wanted to create a space where some of the work was available for viewing. I hope it offers a snapshot into some of my experience, and how I think as an engineer.


All diagrams were created personally by me, and are purposefully general and high-level, to protect confidentiality. The only code showcased in this repository is code that I own, and have written for personal projects.
